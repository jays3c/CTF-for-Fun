### Inflated



Inflated is a reverse challenge in the [Azure Assassin Alliance CTF 2022](https://ctftime.org/event/1682/). It got one solved in the 48 hours of the game. 

Difficulty: hard

Description: The flatten control flow looks so boring. So I inflated it a little bit with exceptions. It looks nice now!
